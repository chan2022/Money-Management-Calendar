# 💰 Money-Management-Calendar

**Money Management Calendar** is a personal finance tracking app designed for visual thinkers who want to stay on top of their daily expenses using a calendar-based view. Whether you're managing a household budget or keeping track of multiple accounts across countries, this tool helps you understand where your money goes, day by day. <br><br>


🧠 **Why I Built This** <br> As an international resident managing both American and Korean bank accounts, I needed a simple and clear way to see my daily spending across multiple currencies and cards. Most apps were too rigid or overwhelming. So I started building my own solution. <br><br>


🗓️ **Key Features (Planned & In Progress)** <br>
  - Calendar-based interface to view and log expenses by day

  - Custom categories (e.g., Grocery, Eating Out, Utilities, Fun, Transportation)

  - Color-coded entries based on the card or bank used

  - Multi-account support, ideal for users managing finances across countries

  - Lightweight and simple, focused on visual clarity and usability <br>

🚧 **Status** <br> This project is currently a work in progress! I'm actively building features, improving the UI, and refining how data is stored and displayed.
